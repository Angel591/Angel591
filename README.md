Hello my name is Angel Briseno and I am studying to be a full-stack software engineer and hopefully I get to work for take-two at some point.
As of right now, I am only interested in studying and freelancing so I can stack my work experiences.
If you are interested in giving me a job or giving my study tips feel free to email me at abriseno007@gmail.com
